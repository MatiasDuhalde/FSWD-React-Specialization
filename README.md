## Overview

This Coursera specialization focuses on teaching web development, techniques, and resources for students to be able to develop their own apps and projects. It consists of four courses divided in specific topics.
This repository contains the finalized project this course proposes. The commit story follows the steps I took for completion.

## conFusion
This is the main project the first course in this specialization focuses on. It's basically a simple multi-page static web app, which uses Bootstrap 4 at its core. Apart from Bootstrap, this project is built using npm and several node_modules, including CSS preprocessors, which I had no prior experience with and proved to be a pleasant surprise to my workflow.

The main takeaway from this part was npm scripts, which I discovered to be a very powerful tool for automating builds and testing. Aside from npm scripts, the course also presents Gulp and Grunt as other "mainstream" tools for scripting and tasking, but it took just one search online to confirm my suspicions: these are not as widely used nowadays as the professor portrayed them. Their libraries or "plugins" get poorly updated, lack several components npm has, etc. So, for now I'll be staying with npm scripts. That doesn't mean I wasn't exempt of problems while using npm scripts. I remember having problems minifying a script just because I used an arrow function instead of the "legacy" way of defining functions (like the course shows). It pissed me off a little that such a simple thing as arrow functions (introduced in ES2015) are not supported by the libraries used in this course. Maybe my previous statement is naive, since at the time of writing this I have zero to none experience and advanced knowledge in Javascript interpretation, and the complexities of translating ES6 to something more archaic. But that doesn't make it less disappointing.

## The follow-up
After completing the first course of this specialization, I jumped straight into the reviews for the next course, instead of starting with the videos. Unsurprisingly, the software used for the React part of this specialization was quite old, and the versions were outdated, and most reviews complained about that. I decided to stop following the specialization and started looking for some other tutorials for React.

## Conclusions
This specialization is old, I saw reviews as old as 3 years, so I'd dare to say it was released in 2016 or 2017. As its common knowledge, web-development frameworks and even JavaScript conventions get updated overwhelmingly frequently, and its difficult for any course to keep up to present-day standards. I can categorically say that this specialization is outdated, as the frameworks, libraries, frameworks, etc. The course and the professor "urge" to use the versions from the original videos, which I'm definitely not fond of. I'd say I'm a special case for that matter, since I absolutely hate using anything else other than the latest release of a library. If you like delving in old software, by all means, embrace this specialization. It's just not my piece of cake.

As I finished writing this, I realized I didn't really talk about the professor. He has a noticeable Indian-English accent, but it is clear and understandable, even at x2 speed (yes, the lessons were slow for my pace). He explained everything quite nicely and clearly, and I didn't feel lost at any point during the first course. I did read reviews saying that the following ones were more difficult to understand and learners often got lost. I, however, did not experience any of that. I would've probably follow the specialization to its end, were it not for the versions.
